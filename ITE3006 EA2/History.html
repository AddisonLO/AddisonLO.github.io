   <h1 align="center">History of Hinatazaka46</h1>
   <h2>The history of hinatazaka46 is quite complicated so I will sperate them into two part.</h2>
   <li>First part: Hiragana keyakizaka46</li>
   <p>When Hiragana Keyakizaka46's mother group Keyakizaka46 hired 1st generation member,
      A chosen girl joined the group late because her parent did not allow her to join an idol group, but
	  it will be so unfair for other groupmate. As a result, management company decide to create a "Under"(spare)group for her.
   </p>
   <p>
	  May 2016, management company announced the news of hiring the new Hiragana keyakizaka46 members.After the audition, there were eleven new members joined this
	  new group, called "1st generation". However, after the fans knew about them and saw their face, they critisized that they were not beautiful enough and think this 
	  new group was screwed. They thought management company chose the wrong people. In this period, member were depressed and thought that joining this group 
	  was a mistake, they should not be here. However, they still though it out.
   </p>
   <p>   
	  At the same time, Keyakizaka46's debut song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDaKPPmDSIE">Silent Majority</a> went viral. Spare group seemed to be not 
	  important anymore so their resource(chance of release new album and singles,have appearance on variety show etc.) was keep reducing. They start to introspect if they should quit the group
	  as soon as possible.At Augest 2017, new members joined the group, called "2nd generation". 1st generation thought they were being abondoned so they locked themself in a room. They eventually came out because 
	  the show is going to start and  staffs consolate for a long time.  
   </p>
   <p>   
	  Fortunately, they didn't quit and value every chance. Finally there was a  chance for them, the Ace of keyakizaka46, Hirate Yurina absent the shows because she was sick but other member can't dance like 
	  her(It's sound ridiculous but it's real)so the show artist become Hiragana Keyakizaka46. All seat were full in this three day show and prove their popularity. Their road seemed to be successfull, they ovwn a variety show.
   </p>
   <p>
      At February 2019, the management company finally decide to  sperate them from keyakizaka46, rename to hinatazaka46, the second stage of their career was start.
   </p>
    <p>Their first song: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xltYMTPJtxE"> Hiragana keyaki</a></p>
   <li>Second part: Hinatazaka46</li>
   <p>After the second debut, they kept doing their very best. At 2019, they published the song "Sonna Koto Nai Yo", this song went viral on youtube, internet, tik tok. Now, this song has over 24 million on youtube.This song pull them
      them onto new height.In the same year, another song "Azato Kawaii" published, this song also went viral on internet,youtube and tik tok(this song has over 20 million on youtube). Apart from that, their variety ability also known by 
      different variety show producer so they finally have more chance to have appearance on different variety show. Also, the best thing is that they will organized three shows at toyko dome(tokyo dome is the ultimate dream for every japanese idol)
   </p>
    <p>   
      Unluckily, in December 2020, Covid-19 pedemic raged in the whole world, the tokyo dome show needed to extend. The shows has been extend twice and finally organized the show in last month. The more unluckily things is due to the pedemic,
	  face-to-face is prohibited, this make the akushukai, an activity that Hinatazaka46 rely on cannot be held. At the same time,
	  online streaming become popular, more people use this method to listen song, buying cd become a outdated method. Not only effect their selling result,
      but also effect their popularity. The expected successfull 2021 has gone. Unluckily things keep coming, Hamagishi Hiyori, Kosaka Nao and Miyata Manamo successively absent concert because of 
	  sickness, the  attend member of every show were not neat.Even in tokyo dome shows, Hamagishi Hiyori infected COVID-19 so she didn't perfrom. On June-July, Watanabe Miho is going to graduate, the mv screenshot is the last neat photo so far.
